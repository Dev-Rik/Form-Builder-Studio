# 🧩 Form Builder Studio

### 🏗️ A No-Code Drag-and-Drop Form Builder built with Angular

**Form Builder Studio** is a dynamic **no-code web app** that lets anyone create fully functional, validated forms just by **dragging and dropping fields** — no coding required.

Built with **Angular**, **Material Design**, and **Reactive Forms**, it allows users to visually design forms, set validation rules, preview them live, and export or share them as JSON templates.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Form Builder Studio** aims to simplify form creation for everyone — developers, HR teams, teachers, or businesses — without needing to write a single line of code.
